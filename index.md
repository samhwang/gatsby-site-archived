## Career Profile

I have always been passionate about computers, and how technology can bring
the world closer. That was the reason why I walked down the path of Software
Development. Besides my studies, I have worked in a lot of Agile teams of up to
10 people, delivering high quality responsive web applications on different
platforms (PHP, NodeJS) for clients in different industries (retail, sports,
and education.)
