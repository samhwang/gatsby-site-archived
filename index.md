# Career Profile

I have always been passionate about computers, the Internet and how people
connect together. That was the reason why I chose to walk down the path of
Software Development. It was to create a link between people where they
can interact with each other, making the world a little closer. Throughout my
past experience and my university studies, I hope I can contribute to my dreams,
and the software development career path, one step at a time.
