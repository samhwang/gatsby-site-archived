I have always been passionate about computers, the Internet and how people
connect together. That was the reason why I chose to walk down the path of Web
Development and IT Support. It was to create a link between people where they
can interact with each other, making the world a little closer. Throughout my
past experience and my university studies, I hope I can contribute to my dreams,
and the software development career path, one step at a time. Besides my main
work focus, I have been trying to venture into other parts of the IT Industry,
with the first and foremost would be Data Science & Data Engineering.
